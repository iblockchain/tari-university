Problem:

These centralized exchanges also want to earn and increase their profits by having their cut of trading fees and [decentralized exchanges are not here yet](https://coinsutra.com/decentralized-exchange-cryptocurrency/).

But if there are no trading fees, I guess there would be NO incentivization of centralized exchanges and hence there would be neither exchanges nor hacks related to them.

 





A cross-chain swap is a traded between two users of different cryptocurrencies



**The process of Atomic swap:**

1. Party A and B agree about terms of exchange
2. Party A publish a contract in Blockchain A
3. Party A send a Secret Hash and contract transaction to Part B
4. Party B audit contract transaction
5. Party B create a contract in Blockchain B with A secret hash
6. Party B send the contract transaction to Party A
7. Party A audit contract transaction from Party B
8. Party A withdrawal from B contract with publishing secret
9. B extract secret from withdrawal transaction
10. B withdrawal from A contract
